# OTC TTTT - Trustless Token Transfer Trade

* You have a token that you want to sell but is not on exchanges and **you seek OTC trade**
* You have giant bags of token that has $1k daily volume and **you want OTC trade**
* You have a friend<sup>1</sup> and you offer him a 5% discount and **you need OTC trade**

<sup>1</sup> *you meet a year ago at a conference and he is a cool guy but wouldn't trust with 1 BTC*

### Design goals

* Simplicity
* Transparency
* Check the code - it's that simple!

### Running tests

`truffle test`

### Known attacks

Front-running:

* https://coindecode.io/how-swim-made-thousands-gaming-the-eos-crowdsale/
* Flash Boys 2.0: https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05234
* If I was that smart I wouldn't be coding such a simple contract

**Workaround:** pass the rate to the `kamikaze` function. YEAH, I've called the function `kamikaze` because I want to make you think and read the code.


### License
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL

WTFPL + immutable laws of the universe *(including but not limited to karma)* are still in play.

Just don't be a dick or an asshole.

### Disclaimer

It's crypto, DYOR (do your own research), always ensure you know what you are doing.
Try on the testnet first. When on mainnet - try with a small amount.
If you don't know how to deploy the code, you probably should not use it.

### Hire me

Do you like my code? Do you like my style? You may want to hire me for side projects.

### Why selling?

A little bit too much:

* Participated in the ICO
* Airdrop
* Bounty: https://github.com/kleros/openiico-contract/graphs/contributors
* Pilot: https://blog.kleros.io/submit-tokens-for-a-share-of-1-million-pnk/
* Hackathon: https://github.com/kleros/hackathon/issues/1

You donâ€™t keep all your eggs in a single basket.

It would irresponsible not to diversify.

I believe in the project and I wil still hodl significant portion of PNK.

While trading some of it, I don't want to crash the market as the daily volume is low - see <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kleros/">CoinMarketCap</a>.

On the upside - the inverse is also true. A few BTC coming in can increase the price. I encourage you to check 

### Desired side effects

1. Do you like my code? Do you like my style? You may want to hire me for side projects.

2. You may want to engage in the Kleros community, become a juror, build future of justice.


### 0x and Uniswap
* https://0x.org/otc - need to figure it out

* https://medium.com/@pintail/uniswap-a-good-deal-for-liquidity-providers-104c0b6816f2 - not much profits

### Be careful with numbers

Some issues: https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/issues/2077#issuecomment-490027735

More issues: https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/issues/1994

Extra caution with the way how you interpret numbers.

JavaScript is losing precision:

`parseInt("1000000000000000000001") === parseInt("1000000000000000000000")`

That's why using BigNumber

That's why sometimes passing numbers as strings.

`toWei`, `fromWei`, `parseInt`, `parseFloat` I made a silly error when writing tests.

The Solidity contract was working fine at all time. It was the JavaScript test that was failing.
